**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is an open-source set of APIs and protocols that enables **real-time, peer-to-peer communication of audio, video, and arbitrary data directly between browsers or devices**, without requiring browser plugins or external software.

It allows web and mobile applications to establish **low-latency, secure communication channels** using standard web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and native APIs.
### **How WebRTC Works (High-Level Flow)**

1. **Signaling**
    
    - WebRTC itself does **not define signaling**
        
    - Applications use WebSocket / HTTP / SIP to exchange metadata (SDP, ICE candidates)
        
2. **Peer Connection Establishment**
    
    - Uses **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)** to find the best network path
        
    - Leverages **STUN** to discover public IPs
        
    - Falls back to **TURN** servers when direct connection fails
        
3. **Media & Data Transfer**
    
    - Audio/Video → sent using **RTP over UDP**
        
    - Data → sent using **SCTP over DTLS**
        
    - Entire communication is **end-to-end encrypted**
